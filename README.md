## Installation

This runs in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). You must install dependencies from the command line using 'npm i'. Create a '.env' ([dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)) file to store your variables. You must have [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) set up, then run the './db/schema.sql' file before using 'npm run seed' to seed the database.

## Usage

From the command line enter 'node index.' The server will start and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) will sync with the database, allowing you to make api calls. I used [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to view the responses, since there is no front-end view for this application.
